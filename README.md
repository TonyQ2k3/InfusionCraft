About
==============================
Infusion Craft is a mod inspired by [Tinker's Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct).

It allows players to infuse their armors, tools and weapons with existing materials to gain new attributes and abilities.

Setup Process
==============================

Step 1: Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.

Step 2: You're left with a choice.
If you prefer to use Eclipse:
1. Run the following command: `./gradlew genEclipseRuns`
2. Open Eclipse, Import > Existing Gradle Project > Select Folder 
   or run `gradlew eclipse` to generate the project.

If you prefer to use IntelliJ:
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: `./gradlew genIntellijRuns`
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can 
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything 
(this does not affect your code) and then start the process again.
